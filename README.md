# CommandWeaver

ðŸš€ **CommandWeaver** is a **highly configurable console application** designed to execute [**Commands**](docs/command.md) (defined in JSON format). These commands allow seamless interaction with **REST services, variable management, and automation workflows**, enabling flexible and script-driven execution.

CommandWeaver is designed with **modularity** in mind, allowing users to extend its functionality with **custom commands and operations**.

## âœ¨ Features

âœ… **REST API Integration** â€“ Make HTTP requests, process responses, and manage authentication.  
âœ… **Variable System** â€“ Use dynamic variables and expressions in scripts.  
âœ… **Session Support** â€“ Manage persistent variables across multiple executions.  
âœ… **Customizable Logging** â€“ Control log levels and output format.

## ðŸš€ Quick Start

To begin using **CommandWeaver**, follow these steps:

### ðŸ“Œ Step 1: Determine File Paths
Run the following command to check where JSON scripts should be stored:
```sh
commandweaver paths

# Example Output (Windows):
# Local path: C:\Users\YourUser\AppData\Local\CommandWeaver\Workspaces\Default\Application
# Current session path: C:\Users\YourUser\AppData\Local\CommandWeaver\Workspaces\Default\Sessions\session1

# Example Output (macOS/Linux):
# Local path: /home/youruser/.local/share/CommandWeaver/Workspaces/Default/Application
# Current session path: /home/youruser/.local/share/CommandWeaver/Workspaces/Default/Sessions/session1
```

### ðŸ“Œ Step 2: Create a Command Script
Save the following JSON file as `commands.json` in the `Local path` or `Current session path`:
```json
{
    "commands": [
        {
            "name": "say-hello",
            "operations": [
                {
                    "operation": "output",
                    "value": "Hello"
                }
            ]
        }
    ]
}
```
> **Note:** Name of the file is not important as long as it has `json` extension.

### ðŸ“Œ Step 3: Execute the Command
```sh
commandweaver say-hello

# Expected Output:
# Hello
```
